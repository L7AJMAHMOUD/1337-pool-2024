Skills developed at C Piscine
=============================
  # C Language
	The first language learned at the 42 network Pool is "C": >> variables,
	pointers, memory allocation (malloc ,free), macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.
 
 # Shell
	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

 # Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.
Soft-skills
===========
# Self-learning and proactiveness
	At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
	are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
	your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

# Teamwork
	On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
	chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
	The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
	common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

# Time management and resiliency
	The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
	they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
	"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
