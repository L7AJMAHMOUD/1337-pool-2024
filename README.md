Skills developed at C Piscine
=============================
  # C Language
	The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.
 
 # Shell
	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

 # Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.
